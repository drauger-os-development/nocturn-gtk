# Nocturn
Drauger OS GTK theme for Strigoi.
Dark theme with red and grey accents, designed to match the aesthetic of the website. 
Based off of the Lim-Red theme, but without unnecessary code (streamlined just for XFCE), and with custom colors, animations. 

# Installation
Copy to /usr/share/themes, then go to your XFCE settings manager, Appearance>Themes and choose 'Nocturn'.
